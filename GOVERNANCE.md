# Governance

## Project model

This project uses a maintainer-led governance model with transparent decision records.

## Roles

- Maintainers: roadmap, reviews, releases, governance decisions.
- Contributors: code/docs/tests/issues/proposals.
- Reviewers: trusted contributors with scoped review permissions.

## Decision process

1. Small changes: issue + PR + maintainer review.
2. Contract changes: proposal issue required.
3. Breaking changes: proposal issue + migration notes + release plan.

If consensus is not reached, maintainers decide and document rationale in the issue.

## Maintainer expectations

- Keep issue and PR triage current.
- Keep roadmap and adapter status current.
- Enforce contribution standards consistently.
- Provide onboarding support for first-time contributors.

## Decision records

For non-trivial architectural decisions, add a short ADR in `docs/`.
